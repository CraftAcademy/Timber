### Acceptance test
Acceptance test are written in Cucumber using Capybara and Selenium with Chrome Driver in headless state.

Features are stored in `./features`

To run the acceptance test suite, execute Cucumber in you terminal:

```bash
$ cucumber
```

### Unit tests
Unit test are written in rspec

```bash
$ rspec
```

#### React Components
This project makes use of React components to offer a rich user experience.

Unit tests for React components are stored in `app/javascript/components/tests`

A sample component with a test can look like this:
```javascript
import React, {Component} from "react"
import PropTypes from "prop-types"
class HelloWorld extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        <div>Hello {this.props.greeting}</div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

HelloWorld.propTypes = {
  greeting: PropTypes.string
};

export default HelloWorld
```

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import HelloWorld from '../HelloWorld';
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16';
import {mount} from 'enzyme'


Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });

let wrapper;

describe('<HelloWorld />', ()=>{
    beforeEach(() => {
        wrapper = mount(<HelloWorld greeting={'Thomas'}/>);
    });

    it('displays contact name', () => {
        expect(wrapper.text()).toContain('Thomas');
    });

});
```

A full list of Jest Matchers can be found on the [Jest reference docs.](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/expect.html)

#### Active Models
Active Record Models are tested using RSpec (model specs)

We are using Shoulda matchers to test the expected database tables, validations and permissions.
We are also allowing, via validations, the objects created by FactoryBot to be tested
